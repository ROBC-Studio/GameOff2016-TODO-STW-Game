## Github-Gameoff-PostMorterm Notes -- 12.1.2016
We weren't able to finish our prototype for this game. Unsurprisingly our scope was quite large. This was a great learning experience however and we are working on finishing at least the first stage of this game for the rest of December. The tech alone and getting familiar with Godot were the best parts of participating. Currently, in this repo we have a test stage with a bunch of NPCs on screen wandering around. If you run into the vision of a NPC it will chase you and "attack". You can pull up a developer terminal to run commands in the world. Currently, there are only commands that turn on different settings for test purposes, but the idea was to have this be a part of the game. The main character can move and 'dash' (unlimited at the moment). There isn't really a game yet as there is no goal and no rules, but are close to something really cool.
